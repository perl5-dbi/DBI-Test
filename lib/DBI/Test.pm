=head1 SYNOPSIS

In Makefile.PL:

    use lib 'lib'; # to allow DBI::Test finds the test cases of your driver
    use DBI::Test::Conf ();
    my @generated_tests = DBI::Test::Conf->setup();
    WriteMakefile (
        test => {
	    TESTS           => join (' ' => 'xt/*.t', @generated_tests),
        },
	clean => { FILES => join( " " => @generated_tests ) }
    );

You provide

    package DBI::Test::Your::Namespace::List;
    
    sub test_cases
    {
	return qw(...); # list of the test cases you provide
    }
    
    package DBI::Test::Your::Namespace::Conf;
    
    sub conf
    {
	my %conf = (
	    gofer => {
			 category   => "Gofer",
			 cat_abbrev => "g",
			 abbrev     => "b",
			 init_stub  => qq(\$ENV{DBI_AUTOPROXY} = 'dbi:Gofer:transport=null;policy=pedantic';),
			 match      => sub {
					 my ($self, $test_case, $namespace, $category, $variant) = @_;
					 ...
				  },
			 name => "Gofer Transport",
		       },
		   );
    }
    
    package DBI::Test::Your::Namespace::Case::Your::First;
    
    ... # will be t/your/namespace/your/first.t
    
    package DBI::Test::Your::Namespace::Case::Your::Second;
    
    ... # will be t/your/namespace/your/second.t
    
    1;

And enhance DBI::Test with own test cases.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module aims to be a test suite for the DBI API and an underlying DBD
driver, to check if the provided functionality is working and complete.

Part of this module is the ability for self-testing using I<DBI::Mock>.
This is not designed to be another I<DBI::PurePerl> - it's designed to
allow tests can be verified to work as expected in a sandbox. This is,
of course, limited to DBI API itself and cannot load any driver nor
really execute any action.

=head1 EXPORTS

=head2 connect_ok

  $dbh = connect_ok($dsn, $user, $pass, \%attrs, $test_name);

connect_ok invokes DBI-E<gt> and proves the result in an I<ok>.
The created database handle (C<$dbh>) is returned, if any.

=head2 connect_not_ok

  $dbh = connect_not_ok($dsn, $user, $pass, \%attrs, $test_name);

connect_not_ok invokes DBI-E<gt> and proves the result in an I<ok>
(but expects that there is no C<$dsn> returned).  The created database
handle (C<$dbh>) is returned, if any.

=head2 prepare_ok

  $sth = prepare_ok($dbh, $stmt, \%attrs, $test_name);

prepare_ok invokes $dbh-E<gt>prepare and proves the result in
an I<ok>. The resulting statement handle (C<$sth>) is returned,
if any.

=head2 execute_ok

  $rv = execute_ok($sth, $test_name);
  $rv = execute_ok($sth, @bind_values, $test_name);

execute_ok invokes $sth->excute and proves the result via I<ok>.
The value got from $sth-E<gt>execute is returned.

=head2 execute_not_ok

  $rv = execute_not_ok($sth, $test_name);
  $rv = execute_not_ok($sth, @bind_values, $test_name);

execute_not_ok invokes $sth->excute and proves the result via I<is(undef)>.
The value got from $sth-E<gt>execute is returned.

=head2 do_ok

  $rv = do_ok($dbh, $test_name);
  $rv = do_ok($dbh, @bind_values, $test_name);

do_ok invokes $dbh->do and proves the result via I<ok>.
The value got from $dbh-E<gt>do / $sth-E<gt>execute is returned.

=head2 do_not_ok

  $rv = do_not_ok($dbh, $test_name);
  $rv = do_not_ok($dbh, @bind_values, $test_name);

do_not_ok invokes $dbh->do and proves the result via I<is(undef)>.
The value got from $dbh-E<gt>do / $sth-E<gt>execute is returned.

=head2 Reporting bugs

If you think you've found a bug then please read
"How to Report Bugs Effectively" by Simon Tatham:
L<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>.

Your problem is most likely related to the specific DBD driver module you're
using. If that's the case then click on the 'Bugs' link on the L<http://metacpan.org>
page for your driver. Only submit a bug report against the DBI::Test itself if you're
sure that your issue isn't related to the driver you're using.

=head1 TEST SUITE

DBI::Test comes with some basic tests to test itself and L<DBI::Mock>.
The same tests are used for basic DBI self-tests as well as testing the
SQL::Statement mock driver.
